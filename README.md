# The Guru - Wisdom Seekers

A card game where ancient wisdom meets modern life. Players take turns as Seekers presenting real-world dilemmas while Wise Gurus respond with teachings from the Bhagavad Gita.

## Why This Game?

The Bhagavad Gita contains timeless wisdom, but its verses can feel distant from everyday life. The Guru bridges that gap by creating moments where players naturally connect ancient teachings to modern challenges—career decisions, relationship struggles, ethical dilemmas, and more.

No prior knowledge of the Gita is needed. The game creates space for reflection, conversation, and connection across generations.

## How to Play

1. **The Seeker** draws a scenario card and reads a life dilemma aloud
2. **The Gurus** (other players) each secretly pick a wisdom card from their hand
3. **Each Guru explains** how their chosen verse addresses the dilemma
4. **The Seeker awards** the round to whoever's wisdom resonated most

**3-8 players • ~20 minutes**

## Game Modes

- **Simple**: Each scenario won = 1 point
- **Advanced**: Scenarios have difficulty scores (1-5 points)
